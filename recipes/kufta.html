    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kufta is made at least a few times a month in different forms. Sometimes grilled, sometimes baked with veggies or even in a tahini sauce. This recipe is really easy to put together and makes for a delicious meal with rice and salad.</p>
    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs of ground beef (85/15)</li>
        <li>1 cup of parsley</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 an onion</li>
        <li>1/2 a red bell pepper</li>    
        <li>1-2 tbsp allspice or seven spice</li>
        <li>2 small potatoes cut into thin slices</li>
        <li>1 onion cut into slices</li>
        <li>1 bell pepper cut into slices</li>
        <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a food processor, blend the bell pepper, garlic, onion, and parsley until fine.</li>
        <li>Add that mixture to the ground beef. Season generously with salt and pepper. Also, add the allspice and mix all together. Do not overwork the meat.</li>
        <li>Take a handful of the meat and shape using the palm of your hands into what looks like a small chubby sausage! I think they look like mini footballs! You can shape them however you like though</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix together the olive oil, tomato paste, salt, and pepper. To that, mix in the veggies and toss. Let them get coated well with this mixture.</li>
        <li>In the desired nonstick baking pan, stack the koftas with veggies in between. Top with some slices of bell pepper too.</li>
        <li>Cover with aluminum foil and bake covered on 375 F for 45 minutes and 15 minutes uncovered. Enjoy with some bread or rice!</li>
    </ol>
